									<h3>Introduction</h3>
                                    <p>Hello, My name is Alisha Dhakal. I am from Nepal and currently living in South Korea as an international student. I came here to pursue my studies and also to gain life experience by becoming more independent. I am hardworking, adaptable, and always eager to learn new things.</p>

									<h3>Preparation for Desired Field</h3>
									<p>I aim to build a career in the <strong> IT field </strong>, specifically in web and graphics design. To prepare for this, I am currently studying Computer Convergence and Information at Cheongam University. I regularly attend job fairs, take part in workshops, and improve my Korean language skills to increase my employability. I also follow job market trends in Korea to understand what skills and qualifications are in demand.</p>

									<h3>Hobbies and interests</h3>
									<p>I enjoy activities that help me grow creatively and technically. In my free time, I explore websites, watch tutorials on web technologies.Apart fron this, I enjoy reading, listening to music, exploring new places, and learning about different cultures. I also like cooking and sometimes try different dishes as well. To stay healthy, I go for walks or play sports like volleyball or badminon.</p>

												<h4>Badminton</h4>
												<p>It helps me stay active, focused, and mentally refreshed. I enjoy playing it both recreationally with friends and in local community groups. It not only keeps me physically fit but also teaches me teamwork, strategy, and quick decision-making, which are valuable skills even in the tech world.</p>

												<h4>Exploring different Platforms</h4>
												<p>Another strong interest of mine is exploring different websites. This habit has improved my sense of visual aesthetics and also helps me stay updated with current web design trends. I often take notes or screenshots of elements I like and try to recreate or adapt them in my own practice projects. These platforms not only expand my knowledge but also inspire me to continuously improve as a designer and developer.

												<h4>Listening Music</h4>
												<p>Listening to music also inspires my design style and mood choice. Music helps me relax, focus, and stay motivated, especially when Iâ€™m working on creative tasks like designing websites or writing code. I even explore music-related websites and apps to observe how they visually represent sound and emotion through design, layout, and animation. </p>

									<h3>Others</h3>
									<p>My goal is to become an independent and skilled designer who can create meaningful digital experiences. I am working part-time to support myself and to build soft skills such as communication, time management, and problem-solving. I hope to contribute to innovative web projects in the future and maybe even start my own design studio one day, combining both my creativity and technical knowledge.
